Hackathon :  Fest'24


A Library Management System (LMS) is a Software Application that Simplifies and Automates the operations of Libraries. It is a complete system for managing library duties such as purchases, member management, monitoring, storing, and circulation. 

The primary objective of an LMS is to properly organize and manage the resources available in a library, making it easier for librarians to conduct everyday operations and create a user-friendly experience for users.
